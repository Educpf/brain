## Domain

Is the **set** of all values that can be plugged into a function and have the function exist and have a real number for a value. The domain avoids division by zero, square root of negative numbers, logarithms of zero or negative numbers.

## Range

Is the set of all possible values the function can take. It can be somewhat difficult to determine.

## Transformations

Changes to functions such as translations, reflections, stretches or compressions

### Translations

In this type of transformation a graph is shifted horizontal and/or vertically without changing it's shape.

**Horizontal**: Caused by chancing **inside** the function's input: $$f(x-h)$$

- $$f(x-h)$$ moves the graph h units to the **right**
- $$f(x+h)$$ moves the graph h units to the **left**

THINK: If the input is changed by **x** units, the graph will move in the opposite direction the same number of units as if it's "**zero**" was now **-x**.

**Vertically**: Caused by chancing **outside** the function's input: $$f(x) + k$$
- $$f(x)+k$$ moves the graph k units to the **up**
- $$f(x)-k$$ moves the graph k units to the **down**


## Composition

The composition of two functions $$f(x)$$ and $$g(x)$$ is as simple as plugging the second function listed as the input of the first one.

$$(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$$
