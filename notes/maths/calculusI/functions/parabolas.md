# Parabolas 

The most general form is: $$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$

Which is essential the simple quadratic ($$ f(x) = x^2 $$) with transformations, if we see it like this: $$f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k$$



### How to draw

The best way to draw a parabola is to first identify where is it's **vertex**, it's orientation, and the interception with both axis.

### Orientation

The orientation can be immediately identified by considering the ***sign*** of the parameter **a** in both forms. If it's positive the parabola opens upwards. 

### Vertex

As we mentioned a parabola can be presented in different forms. Let's consider how to quickly identify the vertex point for each one:

$$f(x) = a(x-h)^2 + k$$ 

-> Vertex equals the point $$(h, k)$$ which can be understood by the transformation logic

$$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c $$
 
-> Vertex equals the point $$(-\frac{b}{2a}, f(-\frac{b}{2a}))$$, which can be understood by thinking about how the first form is transformed into the latter
 
## Convert between forms

Converting to the general form is trivial, the opposite not so much.
The idea is to try to create a perfect square, making it like $$ (x - y)^2$$, by thinking of values are created when expanding a binomal


1. $$x^2$$ must have coefficient 1. Factor the coefficient of x
2. Add and subtract $$(\frac{b}{2})^2$$, consider $$b$$ as $$x$$ coefficient
3. Use the new values to form a perfect square
